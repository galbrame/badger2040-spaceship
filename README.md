# badger2040-spaceship

A very simple obstacle avoidance style game. Obviously not well-suited to the hardware, but was a fun project to build, nonetheless. This project was built on the badger operating system **version 0.0.2**.

Check out a video of [Spaceship in action](https://youtu.be/qSq-_URYxpU).


## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have badger os v0.0.2 [MicroPython .uf2](https://github.com/pimoroni/badger2040/releases) (this is the only version I guarantee this game to run on)
    - NOTE: You can find a very short tutorial on how to upgrade at the end of this [article](https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/getting-started-with-badger-2040)

2. Clone the files in this repo to your local machine

3. Copy the `/space` directory to the root `/` folder of your badger

4. Copy `space.py` and `icon-space.jpeg` to the `/examples` folder on your badger

5. Reboot your badger

You should now see the spaceship game listed on your launch menu. Open it like a regular app - and enjoy!
